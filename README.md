# Harvey

**As of February 2018, Harveytown is no longer actively running for either the website or iOS app.**

Harvey is the Swift package for the iOS app "Harveytown".


**As of December 2017, Hundreds of Southeast Texas families are still displaced from their homes due to Hurricane Harvey.**

Harveytown brings together volunteers and homeowners needing repairs:
* Volunteers can create a profile and specify their skill levels for various repair work.
* Homeowners add their home with photos of the damaged areas.
* Harveytown highlights which homes need repairs matching a volunteer's skill set, and provides a Facebook link to contact the homeowner to schedule repair times.

### Disaster relief takes a community!
